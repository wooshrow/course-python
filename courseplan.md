# Course Plan 2022

----
## Day-1: Foundation
----

#### 9:00 - 10:00. Opening and getting to know each other :)
#### 10:00 - 10:30. Lecture-1 Computation Thinking

Lecture [A01](./alt_lectures/a_Computational_Thinking.md). We will do exercise 1-3. Exer-3 in teams.


#### 10:30 - 10:45. Coffee break.

#### 10:45 - 12:15. Lecture-2 Basic Programming: variables, console I/O, control structures, defining and calling functions.

* Printing, string, number, number operators: [M03](./Lecturenotes/M02_Getting_Started_with_Python.ipynb)
* Variables, assignment: [M03](./Lecturenotes/03_Getting_Started_with_Python.ipynb)
* Input and output: [M03](./Lecturenotes/03_Getting_Started_with_Python.ipynb)
* Boolean expression, if-else, nested-if: [M04](./Lecturenotes/04_Boolean_Expressions_and_Conditional_Branching.ipynb)
* while-loop, beware non-termination, nested loop: [M05](./Lecturenotes/05_Loops.ipynb)
* break statement: [M05](./Lecturenotes/05_Loops.ipynb)
* for loop: [M05](./Lecturenotes/05_Loops.ipynb)
* defining and calling functions: [A06](./alt_lectures/a_Function.ipynb)

#### 12:15 - 13:15. Lunch break.
#### 13:15 - 14:15. Exercises.

We will first explain how to work with with Jupyter, then you can do exercises:

* [M03](./Lecturenotes/03_Getting_Started_with_Python.ipynb): No 1,2,5,6

#### 14:15 - 14:30. Break.

#### 14:30 - 15:30. Lectures.

* Writing your program with a plain text editor, running the program from CLI. Code to try: [coba1](./alt_lectures/coba1.py)
* Using Visual Studio Code (VSC) instead of Jupyter.
* Data Types: list, tuple, dictionary, set. [M07](./Lecturenotes/07_Data_Structures.ipynb)
* Iterating over data.  [M07](./Lecturenotes/07_Data_Structures.ipynb)

#### 15:30 - 17:00. Coffee break, then exercises.

Working on exercises from Lecture-4; do it on your laptop (if you have it one with you) :)  

Exercises:
* [M04](./Lecturenotes/04_Boolean_Expressions_and_Conditional_Branching.ipynb): No. 4
* [M05](./Lecturenotes/05_Loops.ipynb): No. 2. Write your solution as its own function.
* [M05](./Lecturenotes/05_Loops.ipynb): No. 5. Write your solution as its own function. Use string.split() function to split a string into a list of words. You can google the function to see examples of its use.

#### 09:00 - 10:45 Lectures

* Lecture-5 Recursion.
* Lecture-6 Modules, File I/O, and Error Handling.

#### 10:45 - 12:15. Coffee break, then working on exercises.

#### 12:15 - 13:00. Lunch break.

#### 13:00 - 14:45. Lectures.

* Lecture-8: Advanced Programming Concepts (Lambda, Higher Order Functions, and Objects)

## Day-3: Application
----

#### 09:00 - 10:45. Lectures

* Lecture-10: Concurrent and Parallel programming.
