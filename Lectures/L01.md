# Lecture 1: Computational Thinking

## Computational Thinking

* is considered one of the fundamental skills of the 21st century.
* It is about expressing problems and their solutions in ways that a computer could execute.
* coined by Jeanette Wing in 2006 (here is the [original article published in the Communications of the ACM](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/usr/wing/www/publications/Wing06.pdf)).

## Example-1

What would you do with the following instructions?

`Take a piece of paper and a pen.`
`Draw a dot in the center of the page.`
`Draw a rectangle around the dot.`
`Write your name under the rectangle.`

You will probably produce something quite similar to this:

## Example-2

`Take a piece of paper and a pen.`
`Draw two dots close to each other.`
`Draw a short line.`
`Draw a U-shape.`
`Draw a circle around everything.`

## Example-3: Download Times

How many minutes will it take until all 4 files have finished downloading?

## Example-4: Turtle Drawing

A **Turtle Drawing Computer** has these four commands:

1. `forward(x)` - Move forward by x pixels
2. `left(x)` - Turn left by x degrees.
3. `right(x)` - Turn right by x degrees.
4. `jump(x,y)` - Jump to position (x,y).

How to draw this?
